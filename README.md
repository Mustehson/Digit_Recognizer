A digit recognition project that utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for highly accurate recognition of handwritten digits. This project demonstrates how to build a powerful digit recognition system using the MNIST dataset.

## Introduction

The MNIST dataset is a widely used collection of 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9) and their corresponding labels. This project employs a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to achieve state-of-the-art digit recognition accuracy.

## Features
### Deep Learning Framework:
- This project utilizes PyTorch for creating the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, a popular framework for deep learning.
### Data Augmentation:
- To increase the number of examples and improve model robustness, the project merges MNIST data from Kaggle with data from torchvision, resulting in a larger and more diverse dataset.
### High Accuracy:
- The CNN model in this project has achieved remarkable accuracy on the MNIST dataset, consistently scoring above 0.99 on the Kaggle leaderboard.
### Kaggle Competition:
- Consider participating in the Kaggle competition for MNIST digit recognition to benchmark your model against others and share your results with the community.

## Usage
